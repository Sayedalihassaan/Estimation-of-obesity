📚 About the Project:
Our project focuses on using machine learning algorithms to predict and estimate obesity levels based on various features such as age, gender, height, weight, and lifestyle factors. By analyzing a dataset of individuals with corresponding obesity levels, we've developed a predictive model that can assess obesity risk accurately.

🚀 Key Features:

Utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.
Predicts obesity levels based on input parameters.
Provides insights into factors contributing to obesity.
Offers potential applications in healthcare, fitness, and public health initiatives.
💻 Technologies Used:

Python
Scikit-learn
TensorFlow / PyTorch (optional, for deep learning models)
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data visualization)
